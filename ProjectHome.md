Libmonitor is a library that provides hooks into a program and
provides callback functions for the begin and end of processes and
threads.  It provides a separable layer on which to build first-party
profiling tools for performance or correctness.  Libmonitor is easy to
use, scalable and does not require access to an application's source
code.
